In this fork of OM10, I've made lots of edits to [db.py]() that allow fluxes and colors from matched objects found in external catalogs (CFHT, SDSS). A demonstration of the API to this functionality is given in [ColoredCatalogs.ipynb](https://github.com/mbaumer/OM10/blob/master/notebooks/ColoredCatalogs.ipynb). Ultimately, one will want to use this code to make a prediction for the number of lenses found in the PS1 catalog. An example of what such code might look like is given [here](https://github.com/mbaumer/OM10/blob/master/notebooks/ps1qls_forecasting.ipynb).

An issue that derailed our lens classification efforts for a while is that matching to external catalogs requires that the external cat be representative (in terms of fluxes, colors, redshifts, etc.) of the lensed objects output by OM10. A few notebooks that demonstrate the difficulties of (and possible solutions for) this matching, are [matching to CFHT](https://github.com/mbaumer/OM10/blob/master/notebooks/issue19_CFHT_pos_matching.ipynb), [matching to SDSS](https://github.com/mbaumer/OM10/blob/master/notebooks/issue21_sdss_extrapolation.ipynb), and [downloading more representative catalogs](https://github.com/mbaumer/OM10/blob/master/notebooks/issue22_LRG_position_matching.ipynb)
